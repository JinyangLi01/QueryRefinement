   1. Before the current start. Broad sentences to talk about the big picture of database, data science.
   2. eg, users need more diversity in the query results. 
   3. eg, Hotels: chain hotels and other hotels 
   4. eg, House new construction and older homes, initial search stage, don’t know my need yet 
   5. Diversity of results. Fairness, or others

   1. minimal query
